# Available Scripts

Full reference for all npm scripts in this boilerplate.

## Development

### `npm run dev`
Starts the development server with hot module reloading.
- Watches server files for changes
- Automatically restarts server on changes
- Runs on port 3000 by default (configurable via .env)
- Uses nodemon for server watching
- Uses Vite for client hot reloading

**When to use:** Day-to-day development

### `npm run type-check`
Runs TypeScript compiler in check mode without emitting files.
- Validates all TypeScript types
- Checks for type errors across the entire codebase
- Does not generate any output files

**When to use:** Before committing, in CI/CD pipelines

## Building

### `npm run build`
Creates a production-ready build.
- Compiles TypeScript
- Bundles client code with Vite
- Optimizes and minifies assets
- Outputs to `dist/` directory

**When to use:** Before deploying to production

### `npm run preview`
Previews the production build locally.
- Serves the built files from `dist/`
- Useful for testing production builds before deploying

**When to use:** After building, to verify production build works correctly

## Running

### `npm start`
Starts the server in production mode.
- Sets NODE_ENV=production
- Serves built assets
- No hot reloading or dev features

**When to use:** In production environments (Railway, AWS, etc.)

## Code Quality

### `npm run lint`
Runs ESLint on the entire codebase.
- Checks all TypeScript files
- Reports style and code quality issues
- Does not fix issues automatically

**When to use:** To check for linting errors before committing

### `npm run lint:fix`
Runs ESLint and automatically fixes issues where possible.
- Auto-fixes formatting issues
- Auto-fixes some code quality issues
- Reports unfixable issues

**When to use:** Before committing, to clean up code automatically

## Testing

### `npm run test`
Runs the full validation suite: lint, type-check, unit tests, and E2E tests.
- Equivalent to: `npm run lint && npm run type-check && npm run test:unit && npm run test:e2e`

**When to use:** Before committing, in CI/CD, when preparing for deployment

### `npm run test:unit`
Runs Vitest unit tests in watch-less run mode.
- No dev server required
- Test files live next to their source as `*.test.ts`
- Server tests run in a `node` environment; client tests run in `happy-dom`
- Configuration in `vitest.config.ts`

**When to use:** After changing a service, utility, or middleware to verify logic in isolation; fast feedback loop during development

### `npm run test:e2e`
Runs Playwright end-to-end tests in headless mode.
- Runs all tests in `playwright/e2e/`
- Starts the dev server automatically if none is running on port 3000
- Saves traces and screenshots on failure
- Exits when complete

**When to use:** In CI/CD pipelines, before deploying. See [playwright/README.md](../playwright/README.md) for details.

### `npm run test:e2e:open`
Opens the Playwright interactive UI runner.
- Visual test runner with browser preview
- Step-through and time-travel debugging
- Live reload on test file changes

**When to use:** When writing or debugging E2E tests

### `npm run check:i18n`
Validates i18n locale files (optional; only when fully translating all locales).
- Ensures en.json, ar.json, fr.json have the same keys
- Verifies all used message ids exist in all locale files
- Exits with code 1 on mismatch

**When to use:** Before committing when changing UI strings, if using option 3. See [scripts/README.md](../scripts/README.md) and [docs/I18N.md](I18N.md) for details.

### `npm run gen:api-types`
Generates TypeScript API types from the OpenAPI contract.
- Source contract: `docs/openapi.yaml`
- Output file: `src/generated/api/openapi.generated.ts`
- Shared aliases (hand-maintained): `src/generated/api/api-types.ts`

See `skills/api-first/SKILL.md` for the API-first workflow and optional CI drift checks.

**When to use:** After changing API routes/contracts so client and server stay aligned.

## Common Workflows

### Starting a new feature
```bash
npm run dev
# Edit code with hot reloading
npm run lint:fix
npm run type-check
```

### Before committing
```bash
npm run test
```

### Preparing for deployment
```bash
npm run test
npm run build
npm run preview  # Verify build works
```

### Deploying to production
```bash
# On your server or in CI/CD
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

## Requirements

### Development Server
- Node.js 24.13.1 or higher
- npm 11.10.1 or higher
- `.env` file with required environment variables

### Unit Tests
- No dev server required
- Node.js 24+ (same as dev)

### E2E Tests
- Playwright browser binaries: `npx playwright install chromium` (once)
- Dev server starts automatically via `playwright.config.ts` `webServer`
- Tests expect server on http://localhost:3000

## Environment Variables

Scripts use environment variables from `.env`:
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3000)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment (development/production)
- `LOCAL_STORAGE_KEY`: Encryption key for local storage
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Session signing secret

## Troubleshooting

### `npm run dev` fails
- Check that `.env` file exists
- Verify environment variables are set
- Ensure port 3000 is not already in use

### `npm run build` fails
- Run `npm run type-check` to find TypeScript errors
- Run `npm run lint` to find linting issues
- Check console for specific error messages

### `npm run test:unit` fails
- Check the failing test file and assertion — most unit tests are pure and do not need a running server
- If a server-side module fails to import, confirm `SESSION_SECRET` is set in `vitest.config.ts` `test.env`
- Run `npm run type-check` if you see TypeScript-related import errors

### `npm run test:e2e` fails
- Run `npx playwright install chromium` if browser binaries are missing
- Check `playwright-report/` for the HTML report and trace files on failure
- Verify the app compiles correctly with `npm run dev` before running tests

### Type check passes but lint fails
- ESLint checks more than just types
- Run `npm run lint:fix` to auto-fix many issues
- Review ESLint config in `eslint.config.js`
