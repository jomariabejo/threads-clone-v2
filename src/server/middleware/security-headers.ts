/**
 * Content Security Policy for a Vite/React SPA using Chakra UI (Emotion CSS-in-JS).
 *
 * Key design decisions:
 * - script-src (production): 'unsafe-inline' is intentionally omitted. The one inline
 *   script block in index.html uses type="speculationrules", which is permitted by the
 *   'inline-speculation-rules' CSP3 keyword without opening up arbitrary inline JS.
 *   All other scripts load from 'self'.
 * - script-src (development): Vite's HMR client injects an inline <script type="module">
 *   for the React fast-refresh hook, which requires 'unsafe-inline'. This relaxation
 *   is development-only; production builds bundle everything into external files.
 * - style-src: 'unsafe-inline' is required in both environments because Emotion
 *   (Chakra UI's CSS-in-JS runtime) injects styles dynamically at runtime with no
 *   nonce support in CSR mode.
 * - upgrade-insecure-requests is only emitted in production to avoid breaking HTTP-only
 *   local dev servers.
 * - frame-ancestors 'none' takes precedence over X-Frame-Options for browsers that
 *   support CSP level 2+; X-Frame-Options is kept for older browser coverage.
