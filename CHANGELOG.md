## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- Added Vitest 4 unit test suite (`npm run test:unit`) with 69 tests across 8 files covering server config (`api-error`, `redirects`, `auth-profile`), server services (`hashPassword`, JWT sign/verify), server middleware (`globalErrorHandler`), and client utilities (`parseFeatureFlags`/`isFeatureEnabled`, `formatDate`/`formatNumber`/`formatCurrency`).
- Added `vitest.config.ts` with per-directory environment mapping: `node` for `src/server/**` tests, `happy-dom` for `src/client/**` tests.
- Added Playwright E2E test suite (`playwright/e2e/`) with full coverage parity: auth, rate-limiting, WebMCP, accessibility, i18n, layout, routing, security headers, and SEO metadata. Shared `login()` helper in `playwright/e2e/helpers/auth.ts`.
- Added `playwright.config.ts` with `webServer` auto-start, Chromium project, and trace/screenshot on failure.
- Added `playwright/README.md`.
- Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` E2E job to Playwright; `webServer` handles server lifecycle automatically in CI.
- `npm run test` now runs `lint → type-check → test:unit → test:e2e`.
- Added Helmet 8 security headers middleware (`src/server/middleware/security-headers.ts`) covering CSP, HSTS (production), Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, COOP, COEP (production), CORP, X-Content-Type-Options, and X-Frame-Options per OWASP Secure Headers Project 2026 guidance.
- Added `docs/SECURITY_HEADERS.md` documenting every active header, the rationale for each decision, and a hardening guide.
- Added `playwright/e2e/security/security-headers.spec.ts` to verify required headers are present on HTML, API, and static asset responses.
- Added GitHub Actions CI workflow (lint, typecheck, Playwright E2E) plus `.github/ci.env` for non-secret CI env defaults.
- Added `skills/migrate-ci-github-to-gitlab/SKILL.md` to guide migrating CI from GitHub Actions to GitLab CI/CD.
- Added feature-flag starter support with env defaults (`VITE_FEATURE_FLAGS`) and runtime hook-based overrides (`useFeatureFlag`).
- Added `docs/FEATURE_FLAGS.md` to document feature-flag setup and usage.
- Added auth backing starter profiles (`AUTH_PROFILE=local|supabase|postgres`) with setup guidance in `docs/AUTH_PROFILES.md`.
- Added contract-first API documentation in `docs/openapi.yaml` plus generated shared API types under `src/generated/api/` (`openapi.generated.ts`, `api-types.ts`).
- Added `skills/api-first/SKILL.md` documenting the OpenAPI contract location, generation command, and generated output layout.
- Added shared `LoadingFallback` and `BackHomeCta` UI components to reduce repeated loading/CTA markup.
- Added `skills/migrate-design-system-to-shadcn/SKILL.md` to guide full Chakra-to-shadcn migration with explicit removal criteria.
- Added `skills/add-form-manager/SKILL.md` to standardize React Hook Form + Zod adoption, starting with login-form migration guidance.
- Added REST-style auth session endpoints (`POST /api/session`, `DELETE /api/session`) while keeping legacy browser auth routes for compatibility.
- Added `docs/API.md` to document API contract conventions and migration-readiness guidelines.
- Added two migration SOP skills: `skills/migrate-api-to-tanstack-query/SKILL.md` and `skills/migrate-api-to-graphql-client/SKILL.md`.
- Added a localized footer GDPR notice clarifying that only essential cookies are used by default.
- Added `skills/playwright-migration/SKILL.md` to standardize migration from Cypress to Playwright with clear file updates, validation steps, and done criteria.
- Added `cypress/e2e/layout/footer-position.cy.ts` to verify the footer remains pinned to the viewport bottom on short pages.
- Added WebMCP `increment-counter` tool registration on the private Product page, plus Cypress coverage in `cypress/e2e/auth/webmcp-increment.cy.ts`.
- Added Simplified Chinese (`zh`) locale support across the client i18n provider, language switcher, locale dictionaries, and i18n key validation.
- Added a combined policy-writing guide page at `/policies` plus a maintenance SOP in `skills/policy-guide/SKILL.md`.
- Added a config-driven redirect system in `src/server/config/redirects.ts` with middleware integration and E2E coverage (`cypress/e2e/routing/redirects.cy.ts`).
- Added redirect documentation in `docs/REDIRECTS.md` and a reusable agent SOP at `skills/add-redirect/SKILL.md`.
- Added a shared client `Link` component that unifies Chakra UI link styling with React Router navigation and standardized external-link handling.

### Changed

- Migrated from Vite 7 to Vite 8: updated `vite` `^7.3.3`→`^8.0.0` and `@vitejs/plugin-react` `5.1.4`→`^6.0.2`. Vite 8 switches the build pipeline to [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs/) and [Oxc](https://oxc.rs/) (replacing esbuild/Rollup). No `vite.config.ts` changes required — the project's config does not use any deprecated options.
- Updated ESLint ecosystem to ESLint 10: `eslint` 9→10.3.0, `@eslint/js` 9→10.0.1, `eslint-plugin-react-dom` 2→5.7.7, `eslint-plugin-react-x` 2→5.7.7, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` 7.0.1→7.1.1, `eslint-plugin-react-refresh` 0.5.1→0.5.2, `typescript-eslint` 8.56.1→8.59.3, `@stylistic/eslint-plugin` 5.9.0→5.10.0, `globals` 17.3.0→17.6.0.
- Updated runtime dependencies: `@chakra-ui/react` 3.33.0→3.35.0, `framer-motion` 12.34.3→12.38.0, `react`/`react-dom` 19.2.4→19.2.6, `react-icons` 5.5.0→5.6.0, `react-router` 7.13.1→7.15.0.
- Updated `@types/node` 24.7.2→25.7.0 (compatible with TypeScript 5.9).
- Moved `new Date().getFullYear()` in `Footer` to a module-level constant to satisfy the new `react-x/purity` rule.
- Upgraded TypeScript 5.9.3→6.0.3. TypeScript 6 is a transition release bridging 5.x and the forthcoming Go-based 7.0; it introduces new compiler defaults (`strict`, `target`, `moduleResolution`) and deprecates legacy options. The existing `tsconfig.app.json` and `tsconfig.node.json` already used explicit values for all changed defaults, so no tsconfig edits were required.
- Upgraded `react-intl` 8.1.3→10.1.8. Version 10 requires React 19 and TypeScript 5+ (both already satisfied). The project uses only stable APIs (`IntlProvider`, `FormattedMessage`, `useIntl`) — none of the deprecated `FormattedHTMLMessage`/`intl.formatHTMLMessage` APIs — so no source changes were required.
- Removed `SESSION_SECRET` startup validation: the server no longer rejects short or template-like values. The `.envTemplate` now ships with working local-dev defaults (`local-dev-session-secret`, `local-dev-storage-key`) so `cp .envTemplate .env && npm run dev` works without any additional setup. Use strong random values in production.
- Moved OpenAPI-generated TypeScript and shared API aliases from `src/shared/` to `src/generated/api/`; imports use `@/generated/api/api-types`.
- Updated auth verification to route through profile-aware starter mode logic (`local` works by default; `supabase`/`postgres` require provider wiring).
- Updated API auth behavior to favor REST-style `/api/*` responses for API clients while preserving legacy browser form auth endpoints as compatibility shims.
- Reduced duplication across route loading fallbacks, back-home page CTAs, and Express pass-through handlers.
- Centralized repeated rate-limit message/user literals and removed redundant store throttle literal in favor of utility defaults.
- Compacted boundary guidance docs by keeping details in architecture docs and linking from client/contributing docs.
- Refined React boundary placement: route-level `Suspense` now handles lazy page loading, `PageLayout` no longer wraps all page content in a blanket `Suspense`, and product counter actions use feature-level `ErrorBoundary` + local `Suspense`.
- Added React 19 `Activity` around loading fallbacks for route and feature loading states.
- Refactored WebMCP registration logic into `src/client/utilities/webmcp.ts` so the Product page stays focused on view behavior.
- Updated `PageLayout` to use a full-height flex column so the footer consistently sits at the bottom of the viewport.
- Replaced separate Terms/Privacy footer links with a single policy guide link and routed legacy `/privacy` and `/terms` paths to `/policies`.
- Refined testing guidance across `AGENTS.md`, `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `cypress/README.md` to keep E2E contract coverage lean and migration-friendly while still requiring feature-level automated tests at the right layer.
- Simplified `cypress/e2e/seo/page-meta.cy.ts` to assert core metadata contracts without over-coupling to every page-specific metadata field.
- Replaced client-side CryptoJS encryption/decryption with native Web Crypto API (AES-GCM + PBKDF2) in persistence flow.
- Moved `index.html` inline speculation-rules fallback script to `public/js/speculation-rules-fallback.js` so it loads from `'self'` without requiring `'unsafe-inline'` in `script-src`.
- Removed `<meta http-equiv>` security headers from `index.html` (`X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, minimal CSP); all policies are now delivered as HTTP response headers covering every response type.
- Updated `docs/TECHNOLOGY.md` to reflect that CSRF protection and login rate limiting are already implemented (was listed as future work).

### Removed

- Removed unused `ejs` dependency (template system was removed in v1.2.0 but the package lingered).
- Removed Cypress and all related config (`cypress.config.ts`, `cypress/` directory, `skills/playwright-migration/SKILL.md`).
- Removed `crypto-js` and `@types/crypto-js` dependencies.

### Security

- Added Helmet 8 with a full security header suite following OWASP and 2026 industry guidance. Strict CSP eliminates `'unsafe-inline'` for scripts; `X-XSS-Protection` is explicitly disabled (deprecated); HSTS with `preload` is production-only; Permissions-Policy opts out of camera, microphone, geolocation, payment, and ad-tracking APIs.
- Added IP-based rate limiting for `POST /login/password` with configurable env overrides (`LOGIN_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `LOGIN_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`).
